# analysis the way schema.ROLE_STARTING_POINTS is -- treat it as a search
# aid, not a measured fact. Deliberately generous/overlapping (e.g. "dubstep"
# also pulls in "reese"/"wobble"/"growl") since a false-positive candidate
# costs nothing (the calling model still evaluates it via describe_preset
# before using it), while a missed real match costs a lot. Serum's own
# Factory library is organized by instrument/role + rough character (e.g.
# Bass/Reese, Bass/808, Bass/Modulated), not by genre name, so this table
# exists specifically to bridge a genre query to those folder/character
# names -- real third-party packs are often already genre/artist-branded and
# tend to match directly without needing this expansion at all.

    """Search the real preset corpus (Serum's own Factory library plus
    everything in the user's Presets/User folder, including any installed
    third-party banks) by keyword match against each preset's folder path
    and filename, and return the best-matching candidates as JSON.

    Call this whenever a request references a GENRE or an ARTIST'S STYLE
    ("dubstep bass", "something in the style of Flume", "a Reese bass like
    in DnB") before generating from scratch -- grounding a preset in a
    real, already-designed reference (even just to see what filter type/
    FX chain/mod routes it actually uses) beats guessing purely from
    parametric knowledge of the genre. Also useful for a bare instrument/
    role request ("a pluck", "a warm pad") to find real examples beyond
    what ``list_parameters()['role_starting_points']`` already summarizes.

    This is filename/folder-path matching only (no audio analysis, no ML
    embeddings) -- cheap and dependency-free, but only as good as how
    descriptive the corpus's own names happen to be. Real third-party
    packs are often already genre/artist-branded (a pack literally named
    after a genre or producer) and match directly; Serum's Factory
    library is organized by instrument/role + rough character (e.g.
    Bass/Reese, Bass/808, Bass/Modulated, Lead, Pad), not by genre name,
    so a genre query is additionally expanded against a small curated
    keyword table (community sound-design convention -- e.g. "dubstep"
    also searches "reese"/"wobble"/"growl"/"modulated" -- see this
    module's own comments for the full table) to still surface relevant
    Factory candidates when no genre-named pack exists locally.

    Results are a STARTING POINT, not an answer: call describe_preset()
    on the most promising matches to see their actual parameters before
    using one as a reference or as the base for edit_preset(). Zero/weak
    matches don't mean synthesis from scratch won't work well -- this is
    one more source of grounding, not a requirement, and this project's
    own corpus is finite (mostly Xfer's Factory library plus whatever
    third-party banks this specific user happens to have installed).

    IMPORTANT, found live 2026-08-05: some of what this searches is THIS
    PROJECT'S OWN PAST OUTPUT (any preset with metadata presetAuthor ==
    "serum-mcp" -- every result carries an ``is_serum_mcp_generated``
    flag for exactly this). A user reported comparing against 2 such
    banks from earlier sessions and finding them lower-quality and not
    using techniques discovered later in this project's own development
    -- using past self-generated output as a QUALITY OR TECHNIQUE
    benchmark is circular, since it's bounded by whatever this project
    already knew how to do at generation time, not by any independent
    design merit. Prefer non-flagged (genuine Factory/third-party)
    results as the actual quality/technique reference; a flagged result
    is still useful for a narrower purpose -- seeing what was already
    tried for this exact role/style, to build on or deliberately diverge
    from -- but don't treat it as "this is what good sounds like."

    Returns JSON: ``query`` (the original), ``expanded_terms`` (what was
    actually searched for, useful to see if genre expansion kicked in),
    ``count``/``truncated``, and ``results`` (each: ``path``, ``source``
    -- "Factory" or the top-level folder name under Presets/User a
    third-party bank lives in --, ``matched_terms``, and
    ``is_serum_mcp_generated``), sorted by number of matched terms
    descending then path length ascending (shorter/more specific paths
    first among equal-scoring candidates) -- NOT deprioritized by the
    serum-mcp-generated flag, which is informational only (checking it
    for every match, not just the ones returned, would need opening
    every candidate file).
